# ISSUN (一寸)

**A mini game engine for logic-focused games - Build games in ISSUN (一寸) of time**

> "一寸" (ISSUN) means "a little bit" or "a moment" in Japanese.
> Create engaging mini-games in just 1 hour with this lightweight Rust framework.

## 🎯 Vision

**Focus on game logic, not boilerplate.**

ISSUN is designed for developers who want to:
- ✅ Prototype game mechanics quickly (30min - 1 hour)
- ✅ Focus on strategic gameplay, not graphics
- ✅ Build roguelikes, card games, tactics games
- ✅ Learn game development without the complexity

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **System Plugins** - Reusable game systems (80% reuse, 20% customize)
- 🔔 **Type-safe Event Bus** - Publish/subscribe between systems and scenes without tight coupling
- 🌐 **Network-Transparent EventBus** - Same API for local and networked games
- 🎭 **Scene/Context Architecture** - Clean separation of persistent and transient data
- 🎮 **TUI Support** - Built on ratatui, play over SSH
- 💾 **Async Runtime** - Tokio-powered for networking support
- 🛠️ **Derive Macros** - Less boilerplate, more game logic (`#[derive(Service)]`, `#[derive(System)]`)
- 📦 **Service Registry** - Access framework services from game code
- 🚀 **Production-Ready Relay Server** - QUIC-based multiplayer with Docker/Kubernetes support

## 🏗️ Architecture

ISSUN provides traits and macros for clean, DDD-inspired architecture:

| Component | Trait | Macro | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Service** | `Service` | `#[derive(Service)]` | Pure functions (damage calc, drop rates) |
| **System** | `System` | `#[derive(System)]` | Orchestration (turn management, combat flow) |
| **Scene** | `Scene` | `#[derive(Scene)]` | Presentation (UI state, input handling) |
| **Plugin** | `Plugin` | - | Bundles System + Service for reuse |

**Service vs System**:
- **Service** = Stateless, pure logic (like a calculator)
- **System** = Stateful, orchestrates services (like a conductor)

See [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed guide and best practices.

## 🎮 Built-in Plugins

ISSUN provides a rich suite of production-ready plugins following the **80/20 pattern** (80% reusable logic, 20% game-specific customization).

#### **Core Gameplay**
- **`CombatPlugin`**: Handles turn-based combat, including damage calculation and combat state.
- **`InventoryPlugin`**: Provides generic item and inventory management for entities.
- **`LootPlugin`**: Handles loot generation based on rarity, drop tables, and weighted randomness.
- **`DungeonPlugin`**: Orchestrates dungeon progression, including floor advancement and room navigation.
- **`RoomBuffPlugin`**: Manages the application and expiration of temporary buffs/debuffs within rooms or zones.
- **`ActionPlugin`**: Provides a system for managing action points for characters or entities.
- **`SaveLoadPlugin`**: Provides functionality for saving and loading the game state.
- **`TimePlugin`**: Provides game time management, supporting both turn-based and continuous time.

#### **Strategy & Management**
- **`EconomyPlugin`**: Simulates a resource-based economy with multiple currencies, wallets, and exchange rates.
- **`MarketPlugin`**: Simulates a dynamic market with supply/demand, price changes, and market events.
- **`PolicyPlugin`**: Implements a system of activatable policies, laws, or cards with various effects.
- **`FactionPlugin`**: Manages factions, their relationships, and strategic operations.
- **`TerritoryPlugin`**: Manages territory control, development, and their associated effects.
- **`ResearchPlugin`**: Manages a technology tree, research projects, and progression.
- **`ModularSynthesisPlugin`**: Manages a crafting or synthesis system based on recipes and ingredients.

#### **Organizational & Social Simulation**
- **`ChainOfCommandPlugin`**: Implements an organizational hierarchy with ranks, loyalty, and order-issuing.
- **`CulturePlugin`**: Manages organizational culture, personality traits, and alignment.
- **`ReputationPlugin`**: Tracks and manages reputation between different subjects or entities.
- **`SocialPlugin`**: Models social interactions and relationships between entities.
- **`HolacracyPlugin`**: Implements a holacratic organizational structure (a specific management system).
- **`OrgSuitePlugin`**: A suite for modeling complex organizational archetypes and transitions.

#### **Utility & Advanced**
- **`AccountingPlugin`**: Manages budgets, ledgers, and financial settlements between entities.
- **`MetricsPlugin`**: A system for defining, recording, and reporting in-game metrics and analytics.
- **`ContagionPlugin`**: Models the spread of effects or information through a network topology.
- **`EntropyPlugin`**: A system for introducing decay or disorder into the game world.
- **`SubjectiveRealityPlugin`**: A system for managing different perspectives or realities for entities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Write code

```rust
use issun::prelude::*;
use issun::engine::GameRunner;
use issun::ui::{Tui, InputEvent};

#[derive(Scene)]
enum GameScene {
    Title,
    // Add your scenes here
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize TUI
    let mut tui = Tui::new()?;

    // Build game with plugins
    let game = GameBuilder::new()
        .with_plugin(TurnBasedCombatPlugin::default())?
        .with_plugin(InventoryPlugin::new())?
        .with_plugin(LootPlugin::new())?
        .build()
        .await?;

    // Destructure game to get contexts
    let Game { mut resources, services, systems, .. } = game;

    // Add your game state to resources
    resources.insert(YourGameState::new());

    // Create SceneDirector with initial scene
    let director = SceneDirector::new(
        GameScene::Title,
        services,
        systems,
        resources,
    ).await;

    // Run the game loop
    GameRunner::new(director)
        .run(
            &mut tui,
            |frame, scene, resources| {
                // Render your scene
            },
            |scene, services, systems, resources, input| {
                Box::pin(async move {
                    // Handle input and return scene transition
                    SceneTransition::Stay
                })
            },
        )
        .await?;

    tui.restore()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Type-safe Event Bus

`GameBuilder` automatically inserts an `EventBus` resource so systems and scenes can communicate through events:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct PlayerDamaged { amount: u32 }

async fn apply_damage(resources: &ResourceContext, amount: u32) {
    if let Some(mut bus) = resources.get_mut::<EventBus>().await {
        bus.publish(PlayerDamaged { amount });
    }
}

async fn on_update(&mut self, resources: &mut ResourceContext) -> SceneTransition<Self> {
    if let Some(mut bus) = resources.get_mut::<EventBus>().await {
        for evt in bus.reader::<PlayerDamaged>().iter() {
            self.hp = self.hp.saturating_sub(evt.amount);
        }
    }
    SceneTransition::Stay
}
```

`GameRunner` calls `EventBus::dispatch()` at the end of each frame, so events published during frame *N* are consumed on frame *N + 1*. See `crates/issun/tests/event_bus_integration.rs` for a complete flow.

### Use template
* from repo root
```bash
# 1. Install cargo-generate if needed
cargo install cargo-generate

# 2. From the repository root, generate into issun/examples/
cargo generate \
  --path templates/ping-pong \
  --name my-new-game \
  --destination examples

# 3. Run your new project
cd examples/my-new-game
cargo run
```

## 📦 Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
issun = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
ratatui = "0.28"
```
